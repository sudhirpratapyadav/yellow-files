- Terms
	- Backdrivable
	- KV 90, 300, 400
	- torque
	- drivers - FOC/vector
- QDD - Quasi-Direct Drive
	- Efficient backdriveability
	- Lower reflected inertia
	- Better torque control bandwidth (related low reflected inertia and stiffness)
	- Good torque sensing via motor current/electrical power (related to efficient backdriveability)
	- Maaaaybe/probably better backlash characteristics on average?
