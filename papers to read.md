### Papers related to using different kind of input
- nerf as input
- 3d volumetric input -> But I think this should be output not input or say by-product
- **My guess on input is leaning towards basic sensors**
	- Exteroceptive
		- RGB
		- Depth (Although stereo camera can be used but since today's cameras are good at giving depth so no problem)
			- basically if sensor is robust take it as input
			- robust -> noise free, error free in sense sometime depth sensor fail and give arbitrary output
			- So I guess Stereo would work better given more data
				- **or instead of depth - Disparity is more robust input**
		- Touch/Pressure
	- Proprioceptive
		- IMU
		- Encoders - Joint angle, velocity, acceleration
- My thoughts
	- Input -> Sensors
	- Output -> Actuators
	- In between -> should be emergent by-product instead of manually defined constraints
		- Vision
			- Simple receptors/features, objects
			- and ultimately 3D should emerge out of this -> instead of constraints
		- Locomotion
			- gaits, smoothness etc should emerge out of this
		- Planning/Reasoning -> should emerge out
	- Then what could be constraint between these
		- **self-consistency** is also good constraint
			- model should give 1 coherent story
			- if there is contradiction -> means it is signal to learn 
			- **Self/Cross-supervision or Prediction** is good way to implement this self-consistency constraint
				- We can say its **property of locality**
				- Things closer to each other are similar (both in time and space)
		- **Compression or information bottleneck**
			- **Latent** variable is one way to implement this
				- Basically reduce the dimension
				- **We can reduce dimension in both time and space**
		- **Architectures**
			- Architectures which support above 2 things
