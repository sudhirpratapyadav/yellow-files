- Why Manipulation
	- Because it is hard
		- Humungous Hand
	- Useful
	- separates us from animals (tool use)
- Link between animals and us
	- locomotion -> solved using RL videos
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL833P0Vino (deep robotics)
		- Other works
		- RMA and similar
		- Low variation
		- RL
- Manipulation and Vision?
- Can we do manipulation without vision
	- touch based?
- sensors
	- Vision -> RGB, Depth, Pointcloud
	- touch
		- meta, digit, skin etc
- Representations
	- Direct, keypoints
- Ideas/frameworks
	- End to End
	- Intermediate
	- Old School
	- LLM based
	- Liquid NN
- Ongoing
	- Multitask
- Success
	- Imitation learning
	- single policy kind of work now
- Failures
	- Degrade over time
	- Less robust to env changes
	- Robustness require huge data
		- Real vs Sim
	- Delicate/precise/dynamic tasks
		- May be solved using sim
- Sim to Real Gap
- Tools
	- Simulators
	- Real data
	- Teleop
- RL vs Imitation
- Reward, preferemces

Some actual practical cases 
- just pick a object
